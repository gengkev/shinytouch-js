# shinytouch-js
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/shinytouch-js

This project is pretty much defunct, as its predecessor, mentioned below. The code is pretty hacky, as I wrote it
in middle school, so don't judge too hard. It's pretty much just  a port of ShinyTouch from Python to JS, anyway,
not my original thinking; although I certainly did do a lot of thinking.

The predecessor, ShinyTouch, has homes on both [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/shinytouch/)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/antimatter15/shinytouch), and needless to say, it's even more ancient
than this project is.

I already had a GitHub repository with this same name, but it only had a README, so I deleted it
to make way for the export from Google Code. That Git repository probably still exists somewhere
on my hard drive, but oh well.

Here's the project summary from the Google Code page:

---

This is a successor to the original [ShinyTouch](http://code.google.com/p/shinytouch) project, which was 
written in Python. Like it, its goal is to create a method of using any regular monitor as a touchscreen 
simply by mounting a camera to the side. But, of course, it's all written in JavaScript!

The original code comes from one of antimater15's prototypes.

(I don't really know whether I should have made a Google Code project for this or not. Oh well.)

Oh, and my code sucks, don't blame any of it on him :)
